# Investigation of Tumor Heterogeneity

This repository contains code for the paper:

Ahmed, Zafarali, and  Gravel, Simon._ Genetic Diversity in Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters. _Manuscript in preparation_ (2017).

We use [TumorSimulator](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~bwaclaw/cancer-code/) with some modifications found under `./model`. The HCC experimental data was obtained from [Ling et al. 2015](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/47/E6496.short) found in `./clinical_data`.
