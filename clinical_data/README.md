# Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) data from Ling et al.

Data was obtained from:

_Ling, Shaoping, et al._ ["Extremely high genetic diversity in a single tumor points to prevalence of non-Darwinian cell evolution."](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/47/E6496.short) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 112.47 (2015): E6496-E6505.

Distance measures in this data were made using Figure S1 from that paper and ImageJ.
